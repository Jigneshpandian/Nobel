        <p style="text-decoration: times new roman; font-size: 15; "> In it's simplest form, an HTML page is pretty basic and has just three sections. In this video, I'll break down the structure for you. But first you'll need to know a little bit more about the difference between tags and text. So HTML distinguishes between tags and text. Basically, the tags are the hidden code that tells the browser how to display the content. They aren't displayed to the user but they form the backbone of how the webpage actually works.

            Tags are actually pretty easy to spot. They're always inside two angled brackets, like this. Most tags will also appear in pairs. You need an opening and a closing tag. The closing tag always has a forward slash included in it to tell the browser that that's where the tag ends. For instance, let's start with a header for the page. First, I'll open with an opening head tag, like this, which tells the webpage some information about the HTML file it's about to display.
            
            On the next line, I want a title. Let's say, success. The title will be displayed in the browser tab and also what a search engine will list my page as. First, of course, I need to tell the browser that I want a title. So I need to open with a title tag like this. Right, after this, I can add the text I want the browser to display, which in this instance is success. Now, to close this title tag off, all I've got to do is add a closing title tag, which looks like this. Now, the only thing left to do is close the head.
            
            So on the next line, I'm gonna add a closing tag to the header like this. Okay, so, before I move on, there are a few other lessons I can show you using what we've just done here. First up, did you notice that there was no space between the closing and opening of the title tags? This is because spaces inside the start and just before the closing tag have no effect on the display of text. Also, tags aren't case sensitive. So you don't need to use capital letters in writing it, and in fact, it's best practice to just use lower case in HTML.
            
            Last up, did you notice how when I moved down a line from the opening head tag to the title tags, I also indented the text? This is useful because it means that finding different parts of the page is really easy. So this is good practice to indent your code. Most common development environments will do this automatically, or you can format the code when saving the file.
            
            Great, so, now that we've dealt with the basics of tags and text, and how they work in an HTML page, let's go back to the three basic sections of an HTML page. These are the prologue, the head and the body. The prologue tells the browser what type of document it's dealing with. To do this, all I have to add in is the following tags. I open the document up, with !doctype html, then on the next line, open the page with the HTML tag, and at the very end of the page, I'll close it with my closing HTML tag.
            
            The doctype may look like a tag, but it's actually not. Instead, it's a declaration, so it only needs to appear once. It essentially tells the browser which version of HTML the file is being written in, so it knows how to interpret the tags. We know it's a declaration because of the exclamation mark. The head, as you've already seen, is done using the head tag, and normally appears right after the prologue. Finally, the body. This is the area where the content that is displayed in the main browser window on the website will sit.
            
            Again, I'll open up with the body tag. Then, on the next line, add some text, maybe something like HTML is awesome. And then close the body with my closing body tag. And that's it for this video. We've dealt with a few really important concepts here, from the basics of how tags work, a little bit about syntax and formatting, and finally, on the three basic elements of an HTML page.</p>

            <h2 id="css">CSS</h2>
            <p style="color: white; size: 15px;">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]

                CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
                
                Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.[4]
                
                The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.
                
                The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents.[5]
                
                In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL.</p>

                <h2 id="js">JS</h2>
                <p style="color: white; size: 15px;">JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.

                    JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[10] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
                    
                    The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.
                    
                    JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some servers and a variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.

                    Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.</p>
